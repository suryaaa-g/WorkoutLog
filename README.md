# WorkoutLog--https://suryaaa-g.github.io/WorkoutLog/
A form where a user is able to enter data about his/her workout
Using html, css, and JavaScript I made a simple Workout Log form. I plan on connecting this to a database so the data entered can be stored somewhere. I also plan on making it look neater. 

The source code has variables that do not match the intended reason, this is because I first envisioned this project to be a student log for that get the first and last name as well as their age. (I apologize if its confusing, I will change it as soon as I get the time)
